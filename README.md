Scripts
=======

This repository contains some of my scripts which may also be useful for you.

If you have no idea what a script does, better look at the source before running it blindly â€“ it might eat your hard drive!

Some scripts have a `--help`-command-line-option, some show a short help text when you pass no arguments, some just start doing things you maybe don't want them to do.
